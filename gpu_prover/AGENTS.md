## Project Overview
`gpu_prover` is a Rust crate in the `zksync-airbender` workspace that builds CUDA-backed proving components. It uses a custom build script at `build/main.rs` and depends on `era_cudart`/`era_cudart_sys` for CUDA integration.

## Hard Constraints
- Do not modify CMake/CUDA flags.
- Do not change build configuration behavior unless explicitly requested.

## Working Agreements
- Prefer small, targeted changes with a clear rationale.
- Keep edits ASCII unless the file already uses Unicode.
- Avoid changing public APIs unless the request explicitly calls for it.

## Scope Control
- Keep changes task-focused; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Avoid dependency/version churn unless explicitly requested.

## Key Files and Structure
- `build/main.rs`: build script that wires cmake/CUDA integration.
- `native/`: native CUDA/C++ sources and build artifacts managed by the build script.
- `src/`: crate modules; follow existing layout and naming.
- `Cargo.toml`: dependency and feature definitions for this crate.

## Build and Test
- Minimum validation for any code change: `cargo check -p gpu_prover`
- Build: `cargo build -p gpu_prover`
- Test: `cargo test -p gpu_prover`
- Benches: `cargo bench -p gpu_prover`
- Some tests are compute-intensive and should not be run in debug mode; use release mode for those tests: `cargo test -p gpu_prover --release`.
- `test_no_inline` enables `field/no_inline` for this crate's build graph.
- Prefer `cargo test -p gpu_prover --release --features test_no_inline` when CPU-side performance is not relevant; it can notably reduce release test compile time.
- In debug-mode test builds, `test_no_inline` compile-time impact is usually small.
- When CPU-side performance is not of interest, tests can also be run in debug mode.
- Debug builds may fail with stack overflow during compilation; if needed, compile with `RUST_MIN_STACK=16777216`.
- When cargo warnings are not relevant to the task, run cargo commands with `RUSTFLAGS="-Awarnings"` to keep output focused.
- For profiling (`ncu`, `nsys`), first build the target binary/test, then run the profiler on the produced executable directly (do not profile `cargo ...` invocation).

## Build Script Boundaries
- `build/main.rs` is the only Rust entrypoint that wires CMake.
- Unless explicitly requested, changes in `build/main.rs` must be non-behavioral.

## Code Conventions
- Use `log` for diagnostic output rather than `println!`.
- Prefer `rayon` for CPU parallelism when applicable.
- Keep unsafe blocks minimal and justified; comment on non-obvious invariants.
- Add `// SAFETY:` comments for non-trivial unsafe blocks.

## CUDA Notes
- CUDA runtime dependencies are pinned via `era_cudart` and `era_cudart_sys`.
- Do not modify CMake/CUDA flags.
